# Transfer Learning using VGG16 on CIFAR10 Dataset

In this program, we will take a pre-trained model (VGG16) as a base model and we will be adding some layers to it and combine into a single model and this model is used for a classification task.

For dataset we use CIFAR10 dataset. It consists of 60,000 color images, each of size 32x32 pixels, belonging to 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class, it contains classes like Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat etc.
